# Technical Assessment for ReactJS Developer – AI Tools UI Lead

Thank you for taking the time to complete the assessment! Please reach out to your recruiter if you have any questions.

## Description
You are a senior ReactJS developer leading UI efforts for internal AI-powered tools at a digital consulting firm. Your task is to design and build a simple front-end prototype for an “AI Summarizer” tool that simulates integrating with a large language model (LLM) such as OpenAI. The prototype will be used by internal consultants to interact with and visualize AI-generated content.
 
## Task
Build a lightweight ReactJS application (in TypeScript) with a clean, component-based UI that includes:
1.	A text input area for pasting meeting notes
2.	A "Summarize" button to simulate calling an AI API
3.	A loading indicator while processing
4.	A results panel that displays the mock summary output
You’ll simulate the AI summarization using a setTimeout() function that returns a static or randomly selected summary string.
Your code should use modular components and Tailwind CSS. Bonus points for including basic state management, reusable design patterns, or optional enhancements (e.g., dark mode, summary metadata, or clipboard copy functionality).
 
## FAQ
Q: What tools can I use?
A: Use ReactJS with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. You’re welcome to include ShadCN, Headless UI, Zustand, or any libraries you use in your day-to-day work.
Q: Do I need to connect to a real AI API?
A: No. Simulate the AI response with setTimeout() returning a static value. If you do want to show off with OpenAI or Azure OpenAI integration, feel free—but it's optional.
Q: Do I need to write tests?
A: Not required, but a couple of unit or snapshot tests are a plus.
Q: Should I make the UI responsive?
A: Yes. Design for both desktop and tablet views at minimum.
Q: Should I include documentation?
A: Yes. Include a short README.md that explains how to run the app, your design decisions, and any bonus features added.
